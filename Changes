Revision history for AnyEvent::HTTP

TODO: provide lwp_request function that takes an lwp http requets and returns a http response.
TODO: use destroy method, when/if available

	- work around different behaviour of AnyEvent::Handle in TLS mode.
	- cleanup cookie implementation, many examples and comments were
          provided by Дмитрий Шалашов.
        - document the return values of http_* functions better.
        - separate multiple header values by "," not "\x00" (this does not
          break correctly written users of the old API).
        - improve Set-Cookie: parsing.
        - add experimental https-over-http-proxy support.
        - downgrade https-over-https proxy to https-over-http.
        - ignore spurious CR characters in headers, they show up
          in the weirdest of places.
        - ucfirst the request headers, for a slightly less weird look.
